DESCRIPTION

  This code will compute the radial, bond length, and bond angle distributions
  for a MD or CG-MD simulation.  The code is run with no arguments and requires
  an ini file in the current working directory named "cg.ini" for all settings.

SETTINGS

input [lammps_read_data_file]
  This should give a path to the file called in LAMMPS read_data.  
  It is used to determine the bond structure of the system.
(REQUIRED)

dump [lammps_dump_file]
  This should give a path to a LAMMPS trajectory file.  
  This file must have data columns for atom id, x or xs, y or ys, z or zs.
  (see LAMMPS dump documentation).
(REQUIRED)

output [tag]
  This gives a unique string to name the output files created by cg-post.
  The output files will be rdf-[tag]-??.txt, where ?? indicates the index
  of the beads defined.
(REQUIRED)
  
rdf [start] [end] [N]
  Specifies the range and number of bins in the radial density histogram.
(DEFAULT=200)

rdf [start] [end] [N]
  Specifies the range and number of bins in the bond-length histogram.
(DEFAULT=100)

adf [start] [end] [N]
  Specifies the range and number of bins in the bond-angle histogram.
(DEFAULT=180)

type [i] [atom_type]
  Provides the mapping between LAMMPS atom type [i] and a named type [atom_type]
  (which) should correspond to the types in the car/mdf files.
(REQUIRED for all atom types used in bead definitions)

bead [t1 t2 t3 ...]
  Defines a bead.  The index of beads will starts at zero and increments in
  the order that they are defined (for matching up with the output files).
  Following the bead command is a list of atom types that are connected 
  together by bonds.  The atoms types can have wildcards, 
  e.g. o2* will match o2e and o2s, while c*o would match c2o, c4o, etc.
(REQUIRED for all bead definitions)

center [c]
  Defines the index of the atom within a bead that acts as the center of the
  bead (for computing bead-bead distances.)  The bead is zero-indexed,
  (i.e. setting [c]=0 will mean that the first atom in the bead is the center.
  This command sets the definition for the most recently defined bead type and 
  must follow a bead command.
(REQUIRED for all bead definitions)

share [s1 s2 s3 ...]
  Allows a bead to share atoms with another bead.  If an atom is to be shared
  by two bead types, then both beads should define a shared atom.  This command
  also acts on the mostly recently defined bead type.
(DEFAULT - no shared atoms)

Anything in the cg.ini file following a # symbol is considered a comment.
